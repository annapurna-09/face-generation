Face generation using Generative Adversarial Networks

Generative Adversarial Networks
Generative Adversarial Network on MNIST: Train a simple generative adversarial network on the MNIST dataset.

Batch Normalization: Learn how to improve training rates and network stability with batch normalizations.

Deep Convolutional GAN (DCGAN): Implement a DCGAN to generate new images based on the Street View House Numbers (SVHN) dataset.
CycleGAN: Implement a CycleGAN that is designed to learn from unpaired and unlabeled data; use trained generators to transform images from summer to winter and vice versa.
